## Comparison of Feature Extraction Techniques for Sequential Hybrid Quantum Neural Network Architectures in Binary Image Classification.  
Using the MNIST Digit, MNIST Fashion and FER-2013 facial expression dataset all adjusted for binary classes, I explore the use of different image preprocessing techniques within the neural network architectures. Specifically, I compare the use of PCA Feature reduction techniques, Matrix product state feature reduction technique, and truncation of features within the sequential hybrid neural network architecture.  My results show that truncation of features is more effective with simpler datasets, while PCA is more effective with more complex datasets.
